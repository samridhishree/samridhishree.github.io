# Biography

I am a graduate student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Professor Carolyn Penstein Ros√©](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) and work with her research group [TELEDIA](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/MyGroup.html). 

I am currently working on understanding the impact of developer coordination and conversation behaviors on project success in open-source communities on platforms like GitHub. I am also interested in dialog systems and am the member of the CMUMagnus team in the Amazon Alexa Prize competition. 

Prior to this, I was working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft India with the Cloud Data and Application Protection Team.
